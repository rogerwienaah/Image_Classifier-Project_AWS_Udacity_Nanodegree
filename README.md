# AI Programming with Python Project

This image classifier project is a requirement to complete the Udacity & AWS AI Programming with Python Nanodegree scholarship. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
The project utilizes [the dataset of about 8200 images of flowers divided into 102 classes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html). 

## Files
- `Image Classifier Project.ipynb`: a Jupyter notebook, contains the whole project code to build and train an image classifier.
- `train.py`: trains a pre-trained network on the dataset and saves the model as a checkpoint.
- `predict.py`: uses a saved model to predict the class for an input image.
- `cat_to_name.json`: a JSON object with dictionary mapping of the flower names.

## Usage
- Train a new network on a data set with `train.py`
  - Basic usage: `python train.py data_directory`
  - Prints out training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy as the network trains
  - Options:
    - Set directory to save checkpoints: `python train.py data_dir --save_dir save_directory`
    - Choose architecture: `python train.py data_dir --arch "vgg13"`
    - Set hyperparameters: `python train.py data_dir --learning_rate 0.01 --hidden_units 512 --epochs 20`
    - Use GPU for training: `python train.py data_dir --gpu`
    
- Predict flower name from an image with `predict.py` along with the probability of that name. 
That is, you'll pass in a single image `/path/to/image` and return the flower name and class probability.
  - Basic usage: `python predict.py /path/to/image checkpoint`
  - Options:
    - Return top K most likely classes: `python predict.py input checkpoint --top_k 3`
    - Use a mapping of categories to real names: `python predict.py input checkpoint --category_names cat_to_name.json`
    - Use GPU for inference: : `Use GPU for inference: python predict.py input checkpoint --gpu`
